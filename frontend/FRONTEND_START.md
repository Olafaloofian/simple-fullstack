# You've washed up on the frontend shores of your project. Here is where you will handle all the UI and functionality of the app. No time like the present!

To get started, run [create-react-app .] in the terminal. This automated package installer will build out the skeleton of a react app for you.

Next, run [npm i/yarn add axios react-router-dom redux react-redux]. Axios is the main tool you will be using to retrieve data from the backend. React-router-dom will be the tool you use to set up linking and routes.
Redux is used when you are doing an absurd amount of propping.

Add components folder/files, routes file, and api file to the directory. Other files may be needed. This is just a boilerplate after all! Have fun! More information is avaiable in the files themselves.
