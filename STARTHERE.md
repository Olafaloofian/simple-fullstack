# Take a deep breath. You're about to code a full stack webapp. Luckily, you have this boilerplate to (slightly) ease the process. Grab a coffe or a Coke and let's get started!

For the whole proect, you will need to build a frontend and a backend. The frontend will consist of a react app, along with the corresponding routes and stateful/functional components. The backend will consist of server controllers, indexes, and database linking components.

Keep in mind some of these third-party tools at your disposal
* Auth0
* Heroku
* Postman
* SQL tabs
* GitHub
* Redex DevTools
* React DevTools
* Chrome DevTools


Head on over to the backend and start hacking! You're going to do awesome.
